            <h3><b><i>The Battle of Sinhagad, which happened on 4th February 1670, was an extremely important part of Maratha history because of Tanaji Malusare's bravery and intellectuality. Shivaji Maharaj wanted to regain the strategic importance of Sinhagad Fort, which was taken by Mughal general Udaybhan Rathod. Tanaji and his men launched a bold night attack, climbing steep cliffs of the fort and sending the Mughal defenders into shock. After much intense fighting, even though mortally injured, Tanaji's Marathas regained the fort. Shivaji maharaj  words, "Gad Ala, Pan Sinha Gela" (The fort is captured, but the lion is dead), reflected his sacrifice. The battle brought back an important Maratha stronghold and became a sign of bravery, loyalty, as well as Shivaji Maharaj's command leadership.</i></b></h3>
